This Project
============
x get something on the frontend up that can pull the season down for it
x start putting things on redis

* create fill_in_current route function for each route
* call that route with the downloaded thing


* create new queen
* create new episode
* create new player




UI
==

VIEW:
-----
Three tabs:
* plebs  "/"
* queens  "/queens"
* episodes "/episodes"


EDIT:
-----
* add new episode
	* add/remove scoreing from episode
* add new queen
* add new pleb


BACKEND
=======
* get everything at once?

API
===
/seasons/:id
/seasons/:id/plebs/:id
/seasons/:id/queens/:id
/seasons/:id/queens/:id/scores/:id
/seasons/:id/episodes/:id
/seasons/:id/episodes/:id/scores/:id

/current_season/

plebs and queens actually span seasons, so maybe drop that prefix, just have them all hang
but maybe make an api that pulls down everything for a season since that should be everything. 
	* if they are independent of seasons, the plebs still have the season specific "which are my queens" thing
	* maybe this is premature optimization. There's still season specific stuff about all of them. 


DATABASE
========



IN GENERAL
----------
* auto build/run server on save
* something to hit the api server with
* switch to a customized vim?
* build API niceities so that the backend is easy
* have some sort of wholistic client/server dev story

* should be creating tests all the time


EDITOR
------
* auto add ";" to end of line and create new line. 


Spent too much time on
----------------------
* routing


TESTS I SHOULD HAVE CREATED
---------------------------
* post queen: starting in javascript, against a test server, verify that thing is create serverside, that 201 is returned. 
	* needs to be able to run with build && run serer && test
	* needs to reset database stuff in between, or start fresh

tech
-----
* protobufs
* gRPC
* the various aws's
