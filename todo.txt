This Project
============
* get something on the frontend up that can pull the season down for it

x start putting things on redis




UI
==

VIEW:
-----
Three tabs:
* plebs  "/"
* queens  "/queens"
* episodes "/episodes"


EDIT:
-----
* add new episode
	* add/remove scoreing from episode
* add new queen
* add new pleb


BACKEND
=======
* get everything at once?

API
===
/seasons/:id
/seasons/:id/plebs/:id
/seasons/:id/queens/:id
/seasons/:id/queens/:id/scores/:id
/seasons/:id/episodes/:id
/seasons/:id/episodes/:id/scores/:id

/current_season/

plebs and queens actually span seasons, so maybe drop that prefix, just have them all hang
but maybe make an api that pulls down everything for a season since that should be everything. 
	* if they are independent of seasons, the plebs still have the season specific "which are my queens" thing
	* maybe this is premature optimization. There's still season specific stuff about all of them.
